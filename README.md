## Web Dictionary (WIP ANGULAR 9 APP)

I was so pissed off from nowadays dictionary.

Problem 1: only can search one words at one screen, meaning that I need to delete all the text and key in a new text to do a new search.
Problem 2: After those hustle from problem 1, finally I found my definition for my words. But when I get back to my books, I forget which sentence I last read..F\$%K..

## SPEED LIGHTNING THUNDER BOLT DICTIONARY

So yeah, gonna create this speed and convinient web ditionary to solve above problems.
Idea was in a screen, will have multiple cards/panel, each cards/panel equals to 1 words search.
each cards/panel can be fully controled by keyboards. eg, press 1 will focus to panel 1, press 2 will focus to panel 2

## URBAN API

this web app is using free public web api, urban dictionary. source = https://www.urbandictionary.com/
So it is not actually a english dictionary, but ya since its free, I am going temporary use it as my dictionary.
