## About This Project
To have easier and faster word search experience with dictionary.

## Problems With Existing Online Dictionary
- only can search one words at one screen, It would be best to search multiple words in one time.
- Losing track on which line I have last read from my books. Because it took too much steps to delete the text in search text box, key in a new word, click search / enter.

## Solution
- Having multiple cards/panel in one webpage, each cards/panel equals to 1 words search.
- Each cards/panel can be fully controled by keyboards events. eg, press 1 will focus to panel 1, press 2 will focus to panel 2

## Public API Used
This web app is using free public web api, urban dictionary. source = https://www.urbandictionary.com/
So it is not actually a english dictionary, but ya since its free, I am going temporary use it as my dictionary.
